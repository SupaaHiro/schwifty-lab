# About Me

Welcome! I'm Hiro — an electronics-trained technologist who found a new calling in software, cloud-native architectures and Kubernetes.

My journey started during the global pandemic, when a forced slowdown gave me the time to explore Docker, microservices and the cloud-native ecosystem. What began as curiosity quickly became a passion: after years working on industrial automation, I embraced modern software practices and have spent the last decade helping teams adopt more agile, reliable and scalable systems.

This blog is where I share that experience with practical, hands-on content. You'll find:

- Step-by-step tutorials for deploying and operating applications on Kubernetes
- Practical tips for designing microservices and choosing the right primitives
- CKAD preparation exercises and guided examples
- Notes on DevOps practices, observability and cloud-native tooling

## Who is this for?

Anyone curious about cloud-native development — from beginners who want clear, practical explanations to experienced engineers looking for concise, example-driven refreshers. My goal is to make complex topics accessible and actionable.
