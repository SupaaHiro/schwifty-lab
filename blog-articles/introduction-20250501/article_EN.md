## An Unexpected Journey

Almost five years ago, in the midst of a global pandemic, the world came to a halt. Like millions of others, I had to slow down the frantic pace of my life. It was a moment of reflection, both personal and professional, that led me to discover a world that would forever change my approach to technology: Docker and the universe of microservices.

That forced pause was not just a setback but the beginning of a journey that led me to explore Kubernetes, DevOps, and cloud-native architectures. Welcome to my blog, a place where I will share this passion with practical guides, tips, and much more, to make these topics accessible to everyone, from beginners to experts.

## My Story

I'm Hiro and technology has always been the driving force of my passion. After graduating as an electronics technician, I reinvented myself as a software developer over the course of about twenty years, specializing in managing industrial automation systems.

Today, I have been working for over a decade at a multinational company, where I played a key role in modernizing software development methodologies, transitioning from traditional processes to more agile and innovative solutions. My curiosity and desire to simplify complex problems pushed me to explore new frontiers. Thus, in the summer of 2021, I encountered Kubernetes. It was a lightning bolt: the first time I deployed an application on a cluster, I realized that the future of software development was already here, and I couldn’t miss it.

## The Evolution of Technology: A Leap into the Future

Reflecting on what the technological landscape was like when I started in 2004, the progress has been extraordinary. Back then, IT systems were constrained by bulky hardware and monolithic software.

Today, thanks to the evolution of artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and technologies like containers, we can build scalable and resilient applications in ways that were unimaginable at the time. For instance, the rise of generative AI has transformed industries like healthcare and marketing, enabling breakthroughs in diagnostics and personalized campaigns, while the adoption of WebAssembly is revolutionizing the performance of cloud-native applications by allowing faster and more efficient execution in distributed environments.

These changes are not just technical: they have opened new opportunities for developers and businesses, making technology more democratic and accessible.

## Why This Blog?

This blog stems from my passion for Kubernetes, microservices, and DevOps, and from the desire to share what I’ve learned over the years. Often, these topics seem complex or reserved for a select few experts, but I believe that with the right approach, they can be within everyone’s reach.

Here you will find:
- **Step-by-step guides** for deploying applications on Kubernetes.
- **Practical tips** for designing effective microservices.
- **Insights** into the tech trends of the future

My goal is to create a resource in English that is practical, clear, and useful, especially for my local tech community, where resources on these topics are still limited. Whether you are a beginner developer or a DevOps professional, this space is for you.
